<p>I am a freelancer based in Jerusalem, Israel. I am interested in a variety of problems, which I strive to solve using artificial intelligence (AI), ranging from signal processing to epidemiology, through image analysis, logic game and population studies. I believe that most AI problems can be solved with perseverance and methodic investigation, and that the journey is even more enjoyable than reaching the destination.</p>
<p>I have studied economics, demography, statistics and epidemiology at the Hebrew University, Sapienza University, Max Planck Institute, and the University of Strasbourg. I have worked 3.5 years as a PhD researcher at the CNRS, Strasbourg, where I have conducted research in epidemiology of physical activity, using machine learning for signal processing, and innovative concepts drawn from the realms of statistics and physiology.</p>
